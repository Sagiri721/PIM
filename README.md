# Personal Library Manager
Organizador de livros com auxilio da base de dados do Google Books

## Objectives
Creating an application that lets the user manage their own ==personal library database==, that is:
* Add books to the database easily, to that effect, we'll use the Google Books GET API, we can ask for a book title, automatically fetch all the information about the book, and then let the user tweak information, like filling unavailable info, and ask for the status of the database entry.
* The most important part of the app is the library screen, it should allow for many different type of views and sorting. Namely sort by title, author name, release date, etc...
